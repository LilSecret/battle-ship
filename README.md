# 🛳️ Battleship vs CPU _via_ terminal

Play battleship against cpu inside your terminal on a 10 by 10 board. To win you must destroy 5 ships deployed randomly around the cpu's board. Whoever destroyed the other's ships first win the game.

#### **Ship Objectives**

| Amount | Ship Length |
| :----: | :---------: |
|   1    |      2      |
|   2    |      3      |
|   1    |      4      |
|   1    |      5      |

## 🛠️ Technologies

- `Javascript`
- `ReadLine Sync(npm package)`

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` in the project directory to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `node battleship.js` to run the project in the terminal.
4. Have Fun! 🙂

## 🏗️ Development

This was my first **Javascript** project for an assignment in Devslopes Academy to create a small replica of the game **battle ship**.

## 📚 What I Learned

- The basics of creating scalable functions
- Built some reuseable functions
- How to initialize an npm project and use simple npm packages inside project

## 💭 Improvements

- **CPU Striking Delay:** The cpu turn is a bit instant which is a little too fast and adding some sort and delay or loader would be a better user experience.
- **Striking animation:** Adding a display of some sort of the ship being destroyed.
